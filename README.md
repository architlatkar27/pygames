# pygames
This rep is a collection of the pygames that I have made.

To play pySquash:
1. Launch the game from terminal
2. The paddle is controlled by the position of the mouse. Make sure your mouse pointer is within the game area.
3. Once the ball moves past your paddle, the game will end.
4. Check your score in the terminal.
